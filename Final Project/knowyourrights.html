          <h4><br>Birth Control/Abortion Rights</h4>
          <p>Any woman, single or married, including a woman who is under 18 years of age, may obtain birth control medication or devices without the permission of either parent or husband. (Planned Parenthood of Missouri v. Danforth (1976) 428 U.S. 52.) Women may obtain birth control for free or with a small co-payment from a local Planned Parenthood office, or community free clinic, or county health center. (Fam. Code, §§ 6920, 6925.)</p>
<br>
          <p>A married or single woman may legally obtain an abortion in California without the permission of her parents or husband. If you have decided to have an abortion, you should protect your health by seeking medical help as soon as possible. (Abortions must be performed by a licensed physician*, Minors do not need consent of their parents)
  </p>
    <br>      <p>Women have a right to enter a health clinic or medical facility to obtain an abortion without being harassed, threatened or otherwise intimidated. Persons who wish to demonstrate or otherwise make known their objections to abortions also have a right, within legally designated boundaries, to picket, hand out information, pray or carry on conversations with persons entering medical clinics or health facilities.</p>
        <br>  <p>California law makes it a crime to intentionally block a health care facility. (Penal Code, § 602.11.) It is also a crime for a person to harass a child because his or her parent works at a medical facility that performs abortions. (Pen. Code, 11414.) Civil Code section 3427 et seq, makes blocking a health facility a civil tort in which a plaintiff may seek civil damages and injunctive relief against protesters.
  </p>
          <h4><br>How to find it</h4>
          <p>If you qualify for welfare assistance, you may be eligible for assistance to obtain birth control counseling and treatment through the state Family Planning Services.(3) Contact your local health department for more information. Medi-Cal is available for prescription birth control devices.
  </p>
          <br><p>If you do not qualify for welfare assistance, you may still be able to obtain birth control information and treatment at family planning centers and clinics that operate on a sliding scale fee basis.</p>
          <br><p>No woman can be sterilized without her full knowledge and consent. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, §§ 70707.3-70707.7) Medical procedures, such as an abortion, childbirth or cancer treatment, may affect your ability to have children and should be thoroughly discussed with your doctor. If you suspect that a sterilization operation has been performed on you without your knowledge or consent, you may wish to contact an attorney.</p>
          <br><p>No health facility, clinic, county hospital or hospital formed by a hospital district, which permits sterilization operations for contraceptive purposes to be performed, can impose nonmedical requirements, such as age, marital status, or number of children, before they will sterilize you.</p>
          <br><p>Medi-Cal must provide funds for abortions for women who are eligible to receive health benefits. The California Supreme Court has held that California may not restrict state funding for abortions for poor women if it pays for a woman's general medical care. (Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights v. Myers, supra, 29 Cal.3d 252.) However, in l980, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that it was not unconstitutional for the federal government to refuse to pay for abortions for financially-needy women. Therefore, the federal government no longer helps pay for elective abortions. (Harris v. McRae(1980) 448 U.S. 297.)</p>
          <br><p>If you do not qualify for welfare assistance, you may still be able to obtain birth control information and treatment at family planning centers and clinics that
  operate on a sliding scale fee basis.
  </p>
          <h4><br>Domestic Abuse Laws</h4>
        <p>In Section 242, the Penal Code defines battery as a "willful and unlawful use of force or violence against the person of another." Section 243(e)(1) of the Penal Code criminalizes battery within one of the specified familial or intimate relationships. Alternatively, a prosecutor can choose to charge the defendant with battery under Section 243(d) if the defendant "inflicted serious bodily injury" on the victim. Battery under Section 243(d) reflects a greater degree of harm suffered by the victim of domestic violence.
  </p>
          <h4><br>What Can Be Done</h4>
          <P>California state laws allow victims of domestic violence to apply for emergency protective orders and restraining orders in both civil and criminal court. Issuance of a protective order or restraining order does not necessarily depend on physical harm suffered by the victim -- someone who fears imminent harm or who has suffered emotional abuse may still qualify for protection through the California legal system.
  </p>
          <br><P>"Irreconcilable differences" mean that there has been a serious breakdown in the marriage and that there are convincing reasons why the marriage should not continue. As a practical matter, if you and your spouse agree that there are irreconcilable differences and that your marriage cannot continue, the court will usually grant the dissolution without question. (Fam. Code, § 2333.) However, if it appears to the court that you and your spouse may get back together again, the court may delay the dissolution proceedings to allow you time to reconcile, although this does not usually happen. During the period of the continuance, the court may make orders for the support and maintenance of the parties, the custody of the minor children of the marriage, the support of children for whom support may be ordered, attorneys' fees, and for the preservation of the property of the parties. (Fam. Code, § 2334.)</p>
        <br>  <P>The law provides for "no fault" divorce (called dissolution of marriage). This means that to dissolve your marriage and restore you to the state of an unmarried person, it is not necessary to prove that you or your spouse have done something wrong. (Fam. Code, § 2300.) It is only necessary to convince the court that you and your husband have "irreconcilable differences." (Fam. Code, §§ 2310 and 2311.) The other ground for dissolution in California is incurable insanity of one spouse. (Fam. Code, § 2312.) Generally, the only time specific acts of wrongdoing in the marriage are pertinent is when the acts are relevant to the award of custody of the children. (Fam. Code, § 2335.)
  </p>
          <br><P>Under the Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, immigrant victims of domestic violence can qualify for special protections. U-visas, for example,  help victims live independently of their abusers by providing them with work authorization and temporary legal status on the condition that they assist law enforcement in any related investigation. There are a limited number of these visas available each year, but many applicants are able to avoid deportation while they await a final decision on their application. VAWA also prohibits DHS from using information from an undocumented immigrant’s abuser to arrest or deport the victim, unless the victim has been convicted of serious crimes.</p>

          <h4><br>Education Laws</h4>
          <P>The United States Education Act Amendments of 1972, Title IX, generally prohibit educational institutions that receive federal financial assistance from excluding or discriminating against a person on the basis of his/her sex in any educational program or activity. (20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.; and 34 C.F.R. Part 106.) This means that any private school or college that receives money from the federal government must generally be open to both men and women in its admission's policies, and the programs and services offered by the institution may not favor one sex over the other. The disparity in the funding of, and/or the scholarships available for, women's and men's athletic programs may be evidence of a violation of Title IX protections. (Cohen v. Brown university (1st Cir. 1996) 101 F.3d 155.)</p>
          <br><P>Classes at public schools and at private schools that receive federal funds, must be open to both sexes. Classes in homemaking, auto mechanics, gardening, and shop must be open to both male and female students. However, sex education classes may be restricted to students of one sex.(8) (45 C.F.R. § 86.34(e).)</p>
          <br><P>Counselors must not discourage or guide young women away from certain careers such as electronics, medicine, law and police work, just because the counselors believe such jobs to be "unsuitable" for women. Counselors must provide all students, male and female, with available information on all careers.
  (45 C.F.R. § 86.36.)
  </p>
          <br>(34 C.F.R. § 106.41; 45 C.F.R. § 86.41; and Ed. Code, § 230(c).) Schools may not decide to fund only the men's varsity teams, and yet refuse to fund women's varsity teams because of the expense. (Cook v. Colgate university (N.D. N.Y. 1992) 802 F.Supp. 737.)
  </p>
          <br><P>Men and women are entitled to the same privacy in toilets, showers, and locker facilities that they have always had. However, the facilities and services for men and women must be of equal quality. (Ed. Code, § 231; 45 C.F.R. § 86.33.)</p>
          <h4><br>What Can Be Done</h4>
          <P>Students sexually harassed at school may take legal action against school districts. Sexual harassment in the educational setting is defined as "unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature," made by either a teacher or fellow student. (Ed. Code, § 212.5.) The U.S. Supreme Court has held that school districts may be sued for sexual harassment perpetrated by a teacher against a student under Title IX. (Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools (1992) 503 U.S. 60.) Likewise, students harassed by other students may sue a school district for failing to stop sexual harassment if administrators knew, or should have known, that the student was enduring a hostile educational environment, and failed to take prompt action to remedy the situation. (Doe By and Through Doe v. Petaluma City School Dist. (N.D. Cal. 1996) 949 F.Supp. 1415 (holding that the standards for employer liability in work-related sexual harassment cases based on Title VII apply to school districts in student-on-student harassment situations.)
  </p>
          <h4><br>Business Laws</h4>
          <P>It is illegal for a business establishment in California to treat women less favorably than men entering and using the establishment. This means that you, as a woman, are allowed to enter any office, restaurant, bar, or other business establishment on the same basis as any other person is allowed to enter. You must be given the same privileges, accommodations, goods, and services as any other person coming into the place. For example, it is illegal for a restaurant to refuse to serve a woman seated alone if the restaurant will serve a man seated alone. It is illegal for a restaurant to refuse to serve you because of your sexual orientation. (Rolon v. Kulwitsky (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 289.)
  </p>
          <br><P>Businesses cannot discriminate against you on the basis of your marital status, nor can they arbitrarily exclude children from their premises. (Marina Point, Ltd. v. Wolfson (1982) 30 Cal.3d. 721.)
  </p>
          <h4><br>What Can Be Done</h4>
          <P>If you have reason to believe that a business establishment has a continuing practice of denying equal rights because of sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin or disability you may notify the district attorney, city or county attorney, the California Attorney General, or the DFEH. These government agencies have the power to bring legal action to stop the business from future acts of discrimination.
